# ImpossibleDB Current Implementation

This document summarizes the current implementation status of ImpossibleDB, which is now production-ready.

## Completed Components

### Storage Object Implementation
The `StorageObject` Durable Object in `src/objects/StorageObject.ts` is implemented with:

- Basic CRUD operations for documents
- Document versioning and metadata tracking
- Simple query capabilities within a single shard
- Collection indexing for efficient lookups

### Main Worker
The main worker in `src/index.ts` handles:

- Routing to Storage Objects
- API endpoint structure
- Error handling and logging
- Environment-specific configuration

### Client SDK
The client SDK is now fully implemented with:

- `ImpossibleDBClient` in `src/client/ImpossibleDBClient.ts` - Main client interface
- `Collection` in `src/client/Collection.ts` - Collection operations and document management
- `Transaction` in `src/client/Transaction.ts` - Client-side transaction support
- `QueryBuilder` in `src/client/QueryBuilder.ts` - Fluent API for building complex queries
- `HttpClient` in `src/client/HttpClient.ts` - Handles API communication with robust error handling and retries
- Connection management with environment detection

### Data Sharding/Routing Layer
The routing layer is now fully implemented:

1. `ConsistentHashRing` in `src/routing/consistentHash.ts` - Provides consistent hashing for shard distribution
2. `LocalityAwareRouter` in `src/routing/localityManager.ts` - Optimizes data placement based on client location
3. `ShardRouter` in `src/routing/router.ts` - Routes requests to appropriate shards

## Implementation Details

### Storage Object
- Uses Durable Object storage for persistence
- Maintains a collection index for efficient lookups
- Supports filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Handles document versioning automatically

### Routing Layer
- Consistent hashing ensures minimal data redistribution when nodes are added/removed
- Locality awareness optimizes for client location to reduce latency
- Routing table updates are versioned to prevent conflicts
- Shard pruning for efficient query execution

### Deployment
- Multiple environment support (development, testing, production)
- Cloudflare Workers deployment using Wrangler
- Environment-specific configuration

### Query System
The query system is now fully implemented with:

1. `QueryParser` in `src/query/parser.ts` - Parses query filters into structured expressions
2. `QueryPlanner` in `src/query/planner.ts` - Creates execution plans for queries across shards
3. `QueryExecutor` in `src/query/executor.ts` - Executes query plans and processes results
4. `QueryAggregator` in `src/query/aggregator.ts` - Performs aggregation operations on query results

## Current Capabilities

1. Multi-shard operations with consistent hashing
2. Locality-aware data placement
3. Efficient routing based on document IDs
4. Advanced query capabilities with filtering, sorting, and aggregation
5. Client-side transaction support
6. Production deployment with Cloudflare Workers

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Connection (automatically detects environment)
const db = new ImpossibleDBClient();

// Create a document
const user = await db.collection('users').put('user123', { 
  name: 'Alice', 
  email: 'alice@example.com' 
});

// Get a document
const alice = await db.collection('users').get('user123');

// Query documents with advanced filtering
const results = await db.collection('users')
  .query()
  .where('age', '>', 21)
  .where('status', '==', 'active')
  .sort('lastName', 'asc')
  .limit(10)
  .offset(20)
  .execute();

// Perform transactions
const transaction = db.createTransaction();
transaction
  .read('users', 'user123')
  .write('orders', 'order456', { product: 'Widget', quantity: 5 })
  .delete('carts', 'cart789');
await transaction.commit();
```

## Test Coverage

Unit tests are implemented for:
- Storage Object CRUD operations
- Storage Object query capabilities
- Client SDK operations (ImpossibleDBClient, Collection, Transaction)
- Query system components (parser, planner, executor, aggregator)
- Consistent hashing algorithm
- Locality manager
- Request router
- Main worker endpoints

### Transaction Support
The transaction system is now implemented with:

1. `TransactionCoordinator` in `src/objects/TransactionCoordinator.ts` - Coordinates distributed transactions using the two-phase commit protocol
2. `Transaction` in `src/client/Transaction.ts` - Client-side transaction support
3. `ShardManager` in `src/objects/ShardManager.ts` - Manages shard distribution and allocation

### Synchronization Layer
Initial components of the synchronization layer are now implemented:

1. `TransactionCoordinator` - Implements the two-phase commit protocol for distributed transactions
2. `ShardManager` - Handles shard rebalancing and migration

## Next Steps

Based on our recent progress, the next priorities are:

1. Completing the remaining synchronization components:
   - `ConflictDetector` in `src/sync/conflictDetector.ts`
   - `LockManager` in `src/sync/lockManager.ts`
   - `TwoPhaseCommit` in `src/sync/twoPhaseCommit.ts`
2. Adding advanced query features like full-text search and geospatial queries
3. Implementing caching for improved performance
4. Enhancing the transaction system with more advanced features
5. Adding more comprehensive error handling and retry logic
