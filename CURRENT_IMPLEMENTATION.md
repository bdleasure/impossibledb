# ImpossibleDB Current Implementation

This document summarizes the current implementation status of ImpossibleDB, which is now production-ready.

## Completed Components

### Storage Object Implementation
The `StorageObject` Durable Object in `src/objects/StorageObject.ts` is implemented with:

- Basic CRUD operations for documents
- Document versioning and metadata tracking
- Simple query capabilities within a single shard
- Collection indexing for efficient lookups

### Main Worker
The main worker in `src/index.ts` handles:

- Routing to Storage Objects
- API endpoint structure
- Error handling and logging
- Environment-specific configuration

### Client SDK
The client SDK in `src/client/ImpossibleDBClient.ts` implements:

- Document CRUD operations
- Collection management
- Query builder pattern
- Connection management with environment detection

### Data Sharding/Routing Layer
The routing layer is now fully implemented:

1. `ConsistentHashRing` in `src/routing/consistentHash.ts` - Provides consistent hashing for shard distribution
2. `EdgeLocalityManager` in `src/routing/localityManager.ts` - Optimizes data placement based on client location
3. `ShardRouter` in `src/routing/router.ts` - Routes requests to appropriate shards

## Implementation Details

### Storage Object
- Uses Durable Object storage for persistence
- Maintains a collection index for efficient lookups
- Supports filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Handles document versioning automatically

### Routing Layer
- Consistent hashing ensures minimal data redistribution when nodes are added/removed
- Locality awareness optimizes for client location to reduce latency
- Routing table updates are versioned to prevent conflicts
- Shard pruning for efficient query execution

### Deployment
- Multiple environment support (development, testing, production)
- Cloudflare Workers deployment using Wrangler
- Environment-specific configuration

## Current Capabilities

1. Multi-shard operations with consistent hashing
2. Locality-aware data placement
3. Efficient routing based on document IDs
4. Production deployment with Cloudflare Workers

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Connection (automatically detects environment)
const db = new ImpossibleDBClient();

// Create a document
const user = await db.collection('users').put('user123', { 
  name: 'Alice', 
  email: 'alice@example.com' 
});

// Get a document
const alice = await db.collection('users').get('user123');

// Query documents
const results = await db.collection('users')
  .query()
  .filter('age', '>', 21)
  .execute();
```

## Test Coverage

Unit tests are implemented for:
- Storage Object CRUD operations
- Storage Object query capabilities
- Client SDK operations
- Consistent hashing algorithm
- Locality manager
- Request router
- Main worker endpoints

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
1. Transaction support via the `TransactionCoordinator`
2. Conflict detection and resolution in the `conflictDetector` module
3. Advanced query capabilities in the `query` module
4. Analytics and monitoring integration
5. Custom domain setup with Cloudflare
