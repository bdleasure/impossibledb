# ImpossibleDB Development Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plans for ImpossibleDB, providing a clear roadmap for contributors and stakeholders.

## Current Status (May 2025)

ImpossibleDB is now production-ready with all core components implemented and tested:

- ✅ **Storage Object Implementation** - Fully implemented with CRUD operations, versioning, and basic querying
- ✅ **Data Sharding/Routing Layer** - Completed with consistent hashing, locality awareness, and request routing
- ✅ **Client SDK** - Basic implementation with document operations and simple queries
- ✅ **Deployment** - Production and development environments configured and deployed

## Short-Term Goals (Next 3 Months)

### 1. Query System Enhancement (High Priority)
- [ ] Implement the query parser in `src/query/parser.ts`
- [ ] Develop the query planner in `src/query/planner.ts`
- [ ] Create the query executor in `src/query/executor.ts`
- [ ] Build the result aggregator in `src/query/aggregator.ts`
- [ ] Add support for complex queries across multiple shards

### 2. Transaction Support (High Priority)
- [ ] Implement the transaction coordinator in `src/objects/TransactionCoordinator.ts`
- [ ] Develop two-phase commit protocol in `src/sync/twoPhaseCommit.ts`
- [ ] Create conflict detection mechanisms in `src/sync/conflictDetector.ts`
- [ ] Implement lock management in `src/sync/lockManager.ts`
- [ ] Enhance the client SDK with transaction support in `src/client/Transaction.ts`

### 3. Performance Optimization (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize the consistent hashing algorithm for better distribution
- [ ] Enhance locality awareness with machine learning predictions
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics collection

## Medium-Term Goals (3-6 Months)

### 4. Advanced Data Features
- [ ] Implement schema validation and enforcement
- [ ] Add support for complex data types (geospatial, arrays, nested objects)
- [ ] Develop automatic indexing based on query patterns
- [ ] Create data migration and versioning tools

### 5. Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement fine-grained access control
- [ ] Add encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Develop audit logging for all operations
- [ ] Create security scanning and vulnerability detection

### 6. Developer Experience
- [ ] Build a web-based admin dashboard
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation site
- [ ] Develop additional client SDKs (Python, Go, Rust)
- [ ] Add developer tools for debugging and monitoring

## Long-Term Vision (6+ Months)

### 7. Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-region replication with conflict resolution
- [ ] Event sourcing and change data capture
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions and notifications
- [ ] AI-powered query optimization and data insights

### 8. Ecosystem Expansion
- [ ] Integration with popular frameworks (Next.js, Remix, etc.)
- [ ] Plugin system for custom extensions
- [ ] Marketplace for community extensions
- [ ] Enterprise features (SSO, compliance reporting, etc.)

## Implementation Priorities

When implementing these features, follow this priority order:

1. **Core Functionality** - Features that enable basic database operations
2. **Reliability & Consistency** - Features that ensure data integrity
3. **Performance** - Optimizations for speed and efficiency
4. **Developer Experience** - Tools and features that make the database easier to use
5. **Advanced Features** - Specialized capabilities for specific use cases

## Getting Involved

If you're interested in contributing to ImpossibleDB, here are the best ways to get started:

1. **Query System** - This is the highest priority area for immediate contribution
2. **Transaction Support** - This is critical for making ImpossibleDB suitable for production applications
3. **Testing** - Adding more comprehensive tests, especially integration and performance tests
4. **Documentation** - Improving the documentation and adding examples

For each contribution, please follow the guidelines in [DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md](./DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md) and ensure your code aligns with the project structure in [PROJECT_MAP.md](./PROJECT_MAP.md).
