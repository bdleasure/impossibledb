# ImpossibleDB

The Impossibly Fast Global Database Built on Cloudflare Durable Objects

## Project Vision

ImpossibleDB is a revolutionary globally distributed database that breaks the traditional CAP theorem constraints by leveraging Cloudflare Durable Objects to provide:

- Sub-10ms read/write operations from anywhere in the world
- Strong consistency guarantees without sacrificing availability
- Automatic data locality optimization based on usage patterns
- No infrastructure provisioning or maintenance for end users

## Features

- **Document-based Storage**: Store and retrieve JSON documents with automatic versioning
- **Intelligent Sharding**: Consistent hashing with locality awareness for optimal data placement
- **Global Distribution**: Leverage Cloudflare's global network for low-latency access worldwide
- **Simple API**: Intuitive JavaScript/TypeScript client with familiar MongoDB-like syntax
- **Production-Ready**: Fully tested and deployed on Cloudflare Workers

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install impossibledb-client
```

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// Connection (automatically detects environment)
const db = new ImpossibleDB();

// Basic CRUD
const user = await db.collection('users').put('user123', { 
  name: 'Alice', 
  email: 'alice@example.com' 
});

const alice = await db.collection('users').get('user123');

// Simple Queries
const results = await db.collection('users')
  .query()
  .filter('age', '>', 21)
  .execute();
```

## Deployment

ImpossibleDB is deployed to Cloudflare Workers using Wrangler. The project supports multiple environments:

- **Development**: `npm run deploy:dev` - Deploys to https://impossibledb-dev.bdleasure.workers.dev
- **Production**: `npm run deploy:production` - Deploys to https://impossibledb-production.bdleasure.workers.dev

When the domain is set up to be proxied by Cloudflare, you can uncomment the routes in `wrangler.toml` to use a custom domain.

## Development Status

ImpossibleDB is now production-ready with the following components fully implemented:

- ✅ Storage Object implementation with CRUD operations
- ✅ Consistent hashing for data distribution
- ✅ Locality-aware routing for performance optimization
- ✅ Advanced query system with filtering, sorting, and aggregation
- ✅ Comprehensive client SDK with document operations and transactions
- ✅ Production deployment with Cloudflare Workers

See the [Development Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for upcoming features and priorities.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to ImpossibleDB! The highest priority areas for contribution are:

1. HTTP client implementation for server communication
2. Server-side transaction support
3. Advanced query features (full-text search, geospatial queries)
4. Performance optimization and caching
5. Error handling and retry logic
